# How itÂ´s made?
##Frontend: JavaScript, React, Html and CSS.
##Backend: Node.js, Express, MySQL and react-router

The idea behind this app is simple, you upload a post and everyone
who has this app installed can see it. You can follow people to make ther posts more frequent.

Reposts and likes will be my next update/feature
