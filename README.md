# scl-app

This is my social media application. 
-
Frontend is built on JavaScript, React, Html and CSS.
Backend is built on Node.js, Express, MySQL and react-router
-
(Server on the current build uses localhost, but in theory should function just fine on an external server)
-
The idea behind this app is simple, you upload a post and everyone
who has this app installed can see it. You can follow people to make ther posts more frequent.
-
Reposts and likes will be my next update/feature
