# Title
## SCL.

# How itÂ´s made?
## Frontend: JavaScript, React, Html and CSS.
## Backend: Node.js, Express, MySQL and react-router
## (Server on the current build uses localhost, but in theory should function just fine on an external server)

# Description:
## You upload a post and everyone who has this app installed can see it. You can follow people to make ther posts more frequent. This is a very experimental social media idea, I have no frame of reference that how much people will actually like this

# What I learned?

## How to use and work with React better/more efficiently. CSS styling. How to use Node.js as backend
# Future Updates:
## Reposts and likes will be my next update/feature
