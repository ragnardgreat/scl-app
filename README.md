# scl-app

This is my social media application. 
-----------------------------------
Frontend is built on JavaScript, React, Html and CSS.
Backend is built on Node.js, Express, MySQL and react-router
-
(Server uses localhost, cause I ainÂ´t paying for a server, but in theory should function just fine on an external server)
-----------------------------------
The idea behind this app is simple, you upload a post and everyone
who has this app installed can see it.
Reposts and likes will be my next update/feature
-----------------------------------
